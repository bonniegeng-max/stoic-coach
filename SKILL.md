# Stoic Daily Practice

## What It Does

Turn Stoic philosophy into one small practice the user can complete now.

Four independent modes are available:

- **One-Minute Control Check**: separate what can be chosen now from what cannot.
- **Morning Preview**: anticipate likely friction and choose a response before the day starts.
- **Evening Review**: examine one action without self-punishment and choose one adjustment.
- **Situation Practice**: apply a Stoic lens to a concrete decision, emotion, conflict, or setback.

Use only the smallest mode needed. Do not force a full coaching session or a long philosophy lesson.

## When to Use

Invoke when the user explicitly asks for:

- a Stoic or Stoicism-based exercise;
- the dichotomy of control or “what can I control?”;
- a Stoic morning routine, morning preview, or `premeditatio malorum`;
- a Stoic evening review, journal prompt, or daily reflection;
- Stoic help with the user's own decision, emotion, conflict, setback, or uncertainty.

Examples:

- “带我做一分钟控制二分法。”
- “给我一个今天早上的斯多葛预演。”
- “用斯多葛日课复盘我今天发脾气这件事。”
- “哪些是我能控制的？”
- “Apply a Stoic exercise to my anxiety about tomorrow's interview.”

Do not invoke for:

- general advice with no request for a Stoic exercise or control check;
- general philosophy, history, quotation, or comparison questions;
- crisis intervention, diagnosis, or treatment;
- telling the user to tolerate abuse, discrimination, unsafe work, or preventable harm.

The user does not need to know formal philosophical terminology. Natural requests for a control check, Stoic morning preview, or Stoic evening review are sufficient.

## Output Language

Respond in the language of the user's current request. Use plain, non-preachy language and translate Greek or Latin terms when first introduced.

## Choose a Mode

| Request | Mode | Default length |
|---|---|---|
| “我能控制什么？” | One-Minute Control Check | 4 short prompts |
| “晨间预演 / 今天怎么准备” | Morning Preview | 5 prompts |
| “晚间复盘 / 今天哪里没做好” | Evening Review | 5 prompts |
| Concrete decision, emotion, conflict, or setback | Situation Practice | 6 concise sections |

If several modes could fit, choose the smallest one that directly answers the request.

## One-Minute Control Check

Use this sequence:

1. **What happened?** Ask for or neutrally restate one concrete event.
2. **What is mine?** Identify one present choice: attention, words, effort, boundary, or next action.
3. **What is not mine?** Name outcomes, past events, chance, and other people's choices.
4. **What will I do next?** End with one action that can start within 24 hours.

Keep `influence` separate from `control`. The user may influence a result without determining it.

## Morning Preview

Guide the user through:

1. The one situation most likely to test them today.
2. What another person, chance, or circumstance may do.
3. Which response remains theirs to choose.
4. The relevant virtue: wisdom, courage, justice, or temperance.
5. One implementation intention:

```text
If [specific difficulty] happens, I will [chosen response] before [next step].
```

Do not catastrophize. Preview ordinary friction, not every imaginable disaster.

## Evening Review

Use Seneca's review spirit without turning it into moral self-attack:

1. What happened?
2. What did I do well?
3. Where did judgment or impulse take over?
4. What was within my choice at that moment?
5. What one response will I rehearse for next time?

Distinguish responsibility from blame. External constraints and harm remain real.

## Situation Practice

Follow `templates/situation-practice.md`.

Return:

- **Situation**: neutral restatement.
- **Facts and judgments**: clearly separated.
- **Control map**: choice / influence / outside control.
- **Relevant virtue**: one virtue with a case-specific reason.
- **Next practice**: one feasible action.
- **Closing prompt**: one useful question only when an answer would materially improve the practice.

Do not end every response with a question by default. Deliver a complete practice first.

## Safety Boundary

- Stoic practice is philosophical reflection, not medical or mental-health treatment.
- Validate emotions as experiences; do not label them irrational or demand suppression.
- Never use “outside your control” to dismiss injustice, abuse, unsafe conditions, disability, grief, poverty, or structural constraints.
- Encourage appropriate professional or emergency support when the user describes imminent danger, self-harm, abuse, severe symptoms, or a medical/legal/financial emergency.
- Preserve the user's agency. A Stoic frame is an option, not an unquestionable truth.
- Do not fabricate quotations or attribute modern paraphrases to ancient authors.

## Privacy and Persistence

- Use only information supplied in the current conversation.
- Do not create files, write memories, or maintain a streak by default.
- If the user explicitly asks to keep a practice log, explain what would be saved and use a host-approved, user-visible destination after confirmation.
- Do not store sensitive emotional details silently.

## Completion Standard

- The user receives a practice they can complete immediately.
- The response distinguishes control from influence and outcomes.
- It produces one proportionate next action.
- It does not minimize emotion or external harm.
- It stays concise unless the user asks for deeper philosophical analysis.
